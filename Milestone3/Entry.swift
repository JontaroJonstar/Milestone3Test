                            1. Bring to room temp! This makes an amazing difference to cooking through evenly rather than ending up with a thick overcooked band in order for the very centre to be cooked to your liking.
                            2. Pat dry and season the steak generously with salt and pepper – this helps form that amazing crust we all know and love about great steaks.
                            3. Get your skillet SMOKING HOT before putting the steak in – again, for the crust WARNING: The butter will sputter when you add the thyme, so stand back!
                            4. Take the steak off the stove BEFORE your desired internal temperature (see chart below) because the internal temperature will continue to rise as it rests.
                            5. REST your steak for 5 to 10 minutes so it sucks its own juices back in and the fibres relax. This is a must-do step for any protein you cook hard and fast!

                                Preheat oven to 180C/160C fan-forced. Grease 2 x 6cm-deep, 20cm round cake pans. Line bases and sides with 2 layers of baking paper.
                                Step 2
                                Sift 1/2 the flour and 1/2 the baking powder into a large bowl. Add 1/2 the almond meal and 1/2 the sugar. Stir to combine. Make a well. Lightly beat 2 eggs in a bowl. Add to well with 1/2 the oil, 1/2 the milk and 1/2 the vanilla. Stir mixture until well combined.
                                Step 3
                                Divide mixture between prepared pans, spreading to cover bases. Bake for 20 to 23 minutes or until a skewer inserted into the centre of cakes comes out clean. Stand cakes in pans for 10 minutes. Turn, top-side up, onto a wire rack lined with baking paper to cool completely. Repeat process to make 2 more cakes.
                                Step 4
                                Make Frosting: using an electric mixer, beat Nuttelex, vanilla and icing sugar until light and fluffy. Using food colouring, tint frosting pale pink.
                                Step 5
                                Place 1 cake on a serving plate. Spread top with 1 tablespoon jam. Dollop with 1/2 cup frosting, spreading to cover jam. Place a second cake on top. Spread top with 1 tablespoon jam. Dollop with 1/2 cup frosting, spreading to cover jam. Continue layering with remaining cakes, jam and frosting, finishing with cake. Using a long palette knife, spread top and side of cake with remaining frosting. Using the edge of the palette knife (see notes), scrape off some of the frosting to create a slightly ‘naked’ effect. Refrigerate for 20 minutes.
                                Step 6
                                Crush 1/3 of the strawberries. Using the picture as a guide, arrange remaining strawberries and rose petals, if using, on top of cake. Sprinkle with a little crushed strawberries. Gently pat remaining crushed strawberries around base of cake. Serve.

                            2. While the pasta is cooking, prepare the creamy tomato sauce. Dice the onion and mince the garlic. Add the onion, garlic, and olive oil to a large skillet and sauté over medium heat until the onions are soft and translucent (3-5 minutes).

                                1. Preheat the oven:
                                Preheat oven to 500°F. If you are using a pizza stone, preheat it in the oven for at least 20 minutes so it is nice and hot as well.

                                2. Make the sauce:
                                If you are using my sauce recipe, stir together the ingredients. The sauce recipe makes just enough for one large pizza. You can easily double it if you are making more than one pizza.

                                3. Roll out the dough:
                                Roll out dough on a lightly floured surface. If it's hard to roll, let it rest for 5 minutes so it can come to room temperature. For a large pizza, I like to roll my dough into about a 14-inch diameter circle.

                                4. Add the toppings:
                                Transfer the dough to a lightly dusted pizza peel. Alternatively, fit it into a large cast-iron.

                                Add sauce in a light layer all over the pizza, leaving about 1/4-inch crust around the edges. Chop half of the pepperoni and sprinkle it over the sauce. Top the pizza with grated cheese and the rest of the pepperoni. Season with black pepper.

                                5. Cook the pizza:
                                If you're using a pizza stone, carefully slide pizza into the center of the preheated pizza stone. Cook for 6 minutes, then rotate the pizza halfway so it cooks evenly. Cook for another 6-8 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and charred in spots.

                                If you're using a skillet, press the dough into a cast iron skillet and add toppings. Place the skillet over a high heat burner for 2 minutes to get it preheated and get the crust cooking right away. Then transfer to a 500 ̊F oven and bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown.

                                6. Slice and serve:
                                Use pizza peel to slide pizza out onto a cutting board. Let the pizza rest for a minute and slice into pieces. Season with fresh oregano (optional). Serve while warm with a side salad.
